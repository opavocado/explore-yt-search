    "# Experiment: 2. Core Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "As described in ```YT Search - Plan.md```, the user faces a set of issues and limitations when searching through YT. These issues could potentially be addressed through a basic application that integrates with YT API. These issues are:\n",
    "1. Results include Ads \n",
    "   - Seems fixable (ads can be filtered by field 'isPaidPromotion')\n",
    "2. Results include recommended videos that are unrelated to the search\n",
    "   - Seems fixable -> Validating results by keywords included in title/description\n",
    "3. Results provide only just a few videos that are actually related to the search\n",
    "    - Seems fixable -> Request enough pages to get a minimum number of filtered results\n",
    "4. It is difficult to find old videos\n",
    "    - Seems fixable -> Support Search parameters\n",
    "5. It is almost impossible to find videos by date\n",
    "    - Seems fixable -> Support Search parameters\n",
    "6. Can't blacklist channels\n",
    "    - Seems fixable -> A few ways to solve: adding blacklisted channels into query string, filtering out results\n",
    "7. Can't blacklist keywords\n",
    "    - Seems fixable -> Always add blacklisted strings into the query\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "- Implement the necessary functionalities to support the listed issues above\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "- [ ] Define and document Logic (e.g.: query, params, default values, process results, present results)\n",
    "- [ ] Function for filtering out ads\n",
    "- [ ] Function for filtering out unrelated videos\n",
    "- [ ] Query -> set min number of filtered results\n",
    "- [ ] Query Params -> Start and End dates\n",
    "- [ ] Query Defaults -> Blacklist Channels\n",
    "- [ ] Query Defaults -> Blacklist Keywords\n",
