    "# YT Search\n",
    "## Current Situation\n",
    "YT Search is relatively unhelpful:\n",

    "- Difficult to find old videos\n",
    "- Almost impossible to find videos by date\n",
    "- Can't blacklist channels\n",
    "- Can't blacklist keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Research and explore YT's API in order to find ways to solve these issues and enhance the search experience\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "1. Read YT API Docs\n",
    "2. Run Basic Query\n",
    "3. Explore filters and parameters\n",
    "4. List which issues can be solved and how\n",
    "5. Start a backlog of ideas, features and future enhacements\n",
    "6. Fix each issue\n",
    "7. Mockup a Frontend for the tool\n",
    "8. Design the architecture for the tool\n",
    "9. Build it\n",
    "10. Deploy it in GCP/AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Open Questions\n",
    "- When to use video.list() and search.list()?\n",
    "    video.list() -> when videoId is known (one or multiple)\n",
    "    search.list() -> when you have a query string (like the one you use on the search bar)\n",
