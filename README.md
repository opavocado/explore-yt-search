# explore-yt-search
This project is dedicated to exploring YT Data API functionalities.

My personal experience with YT's Search has been far from great (even with the premium subscription). There are a few features and limitations that I would like to adjust for my convenience on both the Android app and desktop site.
As described in YT Search - Plan.md, here are some of the key items:
- Includes Ads
- Includes recommended videos that are unrelated to the search
- Provides only just a few videos that are actually related to the search
- Difficult to find old videos
- Almost impossible to find videos by date
- Can't blacklist channels
- Can't blacklist keywords
